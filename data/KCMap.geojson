In general, resolution is three inches per pixel for urbanized (western) King County and Southwestern Snohomish County and nine inches per pixel in rural (eastern) King County. The U.S. Highway 2 corridor in northeastern King County, and the Alpental area near Snoqualmie Pass are also represented by three-inch-resolution imagery. The imagery in the mosaic was captured by Pictometry International Corp. and licensed to King County for use by cities and other governmental entities only. The imagery was captured from mid-February 2015 through late June 2015.",
